# Magika-Reborn
Inspired by Ars Magica 2, Skyrim, Borderlands and Final Fantasy 12, this magic-based Minecraft mod allows the player to explore their abilities in a new way.

## Key Features
- At the beginning, the player has no mana regeneration. They must unlock augments to gain mana from a variety of sources and actions.
- Spells have randomly generated stats meaning the player must level up to be able to craft a more powerful version.
- To unlock the next tier of abilities, players must level up the abilities they currently have.

## Credit
- I learnt from the tutorials on http://jabelarminecraft.blogspot.com and https://wiki.mcjty.eu/modding/index.php
- I looked at the source code for Ars Magika 2, Immersive Engineering and Tinkers Construct for coding guidance.


## Things to add
- Spellbook. Will hold spells and allow the player to change their names.
- Player binding. On death, an item is dropped. Craft that item with a spell or spellbook to bind it to the player so only they can use it.
- Baubles integration
- Bosses (which drop keys)
- Story (gather all the keys for some reason)

## Feedback
- Got an idea? Great! Let me know.
- Don't like me code? That's OK. I'm a C# developer so may not have written this mod in the "Java way". Feedback is always welcome.
- Coded a fix or new feature? Awesome, send me a PR.
